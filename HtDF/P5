; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a number and produces a blue solid triangle of that size.
; 
; You should use The How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe, and your complete design should include
; signature, purpose, commented out stub, examples/tests, commented out template and the completed function.


;; Number -> Image
;; produces a blue solid triangle of size Number
(check-expect (blueTri 40) (triangle 40 "solid" "blue"))
(check-expect (blueTri 5) (triangle 5 "solid" "blue"))

;(define (blueTri num) "img")

;(define (blueTri num)
;  (...num))

(define (blueTri num)
  (triangle num "solid" "blue"))
