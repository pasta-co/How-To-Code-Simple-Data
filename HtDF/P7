; PROBLEM:
; 
; You might want to create boxes of different colours.
; 
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes a color, and creates a 
; solid 10x10 square of that colour.  Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented out versions of
; the stub and template.
; 


;; String -> Image
;; produces a solid square of the color imputed
(check-expect (makeBox "yellow") (square 10 "solid" "yellow"))
(check-expect (makeBox "blue") (square 10 "solid" "blue"))

;(define (makeBox color) 0)

;(define (makeBox color)
;  (...color))

(define (makeBox color)
  (square 10 "solid" color))
